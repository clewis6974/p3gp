	  <h1>Interests</h1>

	  <h1>Where I grew up</h1>
	  <p> I grew up in a city located in Orlando Florida. It was a small town named Ocoee. I grew up here until I was 10 years old. We moved to North carolina in 2015 and I like it way better up here. The weather is better, I like schools here way better and I feel like I genuinely enjoy the town of Concord more thant Ocoee. I will go back to Ocoee one day to see what it is like since I have left but I have no intentions of living there again.</p>

	  <h1>Future Plans</h1>
	  <p>I plan to attend a four year university either in state or one of the bordering states. The top schools I want to get into are UNCC, Clemson, NC State, Virginia Tech, University of Georgia, University of South Carolina, UNC Chapel Hill, Appalachian State, UNCW, and a few more. I would like to go to college to eventually become a pediatrician which sucks because of the schooling it requires but those are my current future plans.</p>
